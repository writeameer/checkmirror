// Package exepath provides information on the path used to invoke the running
// program.
//
// Relativity
//
// This package is distinct from other packages providing similar functionality
// because the path it provides is not realpath'd. That is, if a binary was
// executed via a symlink, the path expressed is still expressed in terms of
// that symlink. This is useful if you wish to use relative paths.
//
// For example:
//
//   /here/foo/
//     bin: symlink to /somewhere/else/bin
//     data.txt
//
//   /somewhere/else/bin
//     foo
//
//   /here/foo$ ./bin/foo
//
// Here Abs in this package will specify /here/foo/bin/foo, meaning that
// Join(Dir(Abs), "..") leads to /here/foo, not /somewhere/else, allowing
// easy access to data.txt.

func getRawPath() string {
	// "github.com/kardianos/osext".Executable looks nice, but may return the
	// realpath of the path because this is how the kernel returns it as
	// /proc/self/exe. This causes problems with layouts like
	//
	//   some-work-directory/
	//     bin/ -> symlink to $GOPATH/bin
	//     src/ -> symlink to $GOPATH/src
	//     etc/
	//       ... configuration files ...
	//
	// where bin/foo is executed from some-work-directory and expects to find files in etc/.
	// Since -fork reexecutes with the exepath.Abs path, this prevents paths like
	//   $BIN/../etc/foo.conf from working (where $BIN is the dir of the executable path).
	//
	// Okay, maybe this is a byzantine configuration. But still, this breaks my existing
	// configuration, so I'm sticking with os.Args[0] for now, as -fork should be as seamless
	// as possible to relying applications.
