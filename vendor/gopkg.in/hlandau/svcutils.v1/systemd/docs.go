// Package systemd provides functions for detecting and working with the
// systemd service manager.
//
// It is based on other packages such as github.com/coreos/go-systemd/util,
// but that package has become more complicated and dependent on cgo, so
// a small amount of its more pertinent functionality is duplicated here.
